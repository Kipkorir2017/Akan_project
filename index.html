        <h3>Get your Akan Name and the Day you were Born</h3>
        <p>The Akan people of Ghana frequently name their children 
            after the day of the week they were born and the order 
            in which they were born. These "day names" have further
             meanings concerning the soul and character of the person. Middle 
            names have considerably more variety and can refer to their birth order, 
            twin status, or an ancestor's middle name.</p>
